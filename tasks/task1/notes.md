Ways:
    Thresholding: This method involves setting a threshold value and classifying each pixel in the image as either foreground or background based on whether its intensity is above or below the threshold.

    Edge detection: This method involves detecting edges in the image using various edge detection algorithms. Once the edges are detected, they can be used to segment the foreground from the background.

    Morphological operations: Morphological operations, such as erosion and dilation, can be used to separate the foreground and background in an image. This approach works well for images with relatively uniform and smooth backgrounds.

    Region-based segmentation: This method involves grouping pixels into regions based on some criteria, such as color or texture. Once the regions are defined, they can be classified as foreground or background.

    Machine learning-based segmentation: This method involves training a machine learning model to segment the image. The model is typically trained on a large dataset of annotated images, and it learns to segment the foreground and background based on the features it extracts from the image.

These are just a few examples, and there are many other methods for segmenting the background of an image, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The choice of method depends on the specific characteristics of the image and the application requirements.

-Combination of methods

    "A Robust Method for Background Segmentation Based on Edge Detection and Morphological Operations" by H. Zhang et al. (2016)

    "An Efficient Background Segmentation Algorithm Based on Edge Detection and Morphological Operations" by A. Nasir and M. Asif (2017)

    "Robust background segmentation using morphological operations and edge detection for video surveillance" by A. Al-Khaffaf et al. (2019)

    "A background segmentation method using edge detection and morphological operations for video surveillance systems" by H. Wang et al. (2020)

All of these papers use a combination of edge detection and morphological operations for background segmentation, with some variations in the specific techniques and algorithms used. You may want to review these papers to see which approach would be most suitable for your specific application.
